//alright .
time complexity != time taken
T.C - is the rate at which the time taken increases based on the INPUT SIZE
Big O expression = O(4N+N)


T.c consists of three case - 
Best - omega,
Average - theta ,
Worst - O.
Average = (best + worst )/2

AVOID CONSTANTS eg:(n power 100 + 23) here constant 23 is nothing when compared to so ignore it
AVOID LOWER VALUES , eg(4 power 15 + 3 power 10) here 3 power 10 is avoided bcoz its too small
Remember that always compute the WORST CASE complexity of a program.


EXAMPLE:
for(i,n,i++){ for(j,n,j++)}
the t.c is n power 2= n*n

EXAMPLE 2:
for (i,n,i++){for(j=0,j<=i;j++)}
the t.c is n/2 since video 23:25 must watch



Space complexity

Aux space + Input Space

code is sent to servers usually and most servers take 1s = 10 power 8 memory space ;
