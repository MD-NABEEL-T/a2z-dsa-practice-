Iterator is used to traverse a collection safely and modify it (especially remove elements) without errors.

1️⃣ Can Iterator be used for ANY data structure?
❌ NO — not for everything
✅ YES — for Java Collections
Iterator works with:
✔ ArrayList
✔ LinkedList
✔ HashSet
✔ TreeSet
✔ PriorityQueue
✔ ArrayDeque
✔ Vector

Because all of these implement Collection.
❌ Iterator does NOT work with:
❌ Arrays (int[], String[])
❌ Stack (legacy Stack class uses Enumeration mainly)
❌ Custom classes (unless you implement Iterable)
