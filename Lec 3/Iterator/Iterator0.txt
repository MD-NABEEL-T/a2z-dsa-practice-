👉 Iterator is an object

Not magic.
Not a loop.
Just a helper object whose only job is:

Go through a collection one element at a time, safely.

📌 Proper definition (exam-ready)

Iterator is an interface in Java (java.util.Iterator) that allows sequential access to elements of a Collection and supports safe removal of elements during traversal.

If you write this in exams → full marks.

🤔 Why do we even need Iterator?

Because Collections don’t behave like arrays.

Arrays:
arr[0], arr[1], arr[2]


Index-based ✅

Collections (Set, Queue, etc.):

No index

Order may change

Direct access not allowed

👉 Java said:
“Fine, I’ll give you ONE universal way to move through them”
➡️ Iterator

🧩 What does an Iterator internally have?

Think of it like a finger/pointer 👇

[10] [20] [30] [40]
  ^
 (Iterator)


It always points between elements, not on them.

🛠 Methods inside Iterator (ONLY 3 — easy)
hasNext()   // Is there a next element?
next()      // Give me the next element
remove()    // Remove the current element (SAFE)


That’s it. No more.

🔁 How Iterator actually works (step by step)
Iterator<Integer> it = list.iterator();

Step 1:

Iterator starts before first element

| 10 | 20 | 30 |
^

Step 2:
it.hasNext();  // true
it.next();     // returns 10


Pointer moves forward:

| 10 | 20 | 30 |
      ^

Step 3:
it.next(); // returns 20

| 10 | 20 | 30 |
           ^

🗑 Why remove() exists ONLY in Iterator
❌ This is NOT allowed:
for(Integer x : list) {
    list.remove(x); // ❌ crash
}

✅ This IS allowed:
Iterator<Integer> it = list.iterator();
while(it.hasNext()) {
    Integer x = it.next();
    if(x == 20) {
        it.remove(); // ✅ safe
    }
}

🧠 Why?

Because:

Iterator knows which element was last returned

It updates internal structure safely
