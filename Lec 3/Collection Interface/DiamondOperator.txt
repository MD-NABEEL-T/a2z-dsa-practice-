The <> in the declaration ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>(); 
is the diamond operator in Java
It is syntactic sugar introduced in Java 7 to simplify the instantiation of generic classes [1, 2]. 

Explanation
Generics: The angle brackets are fundamentally used to specify that the ArrayList will hold a specific type of object—in this case, Integer objects. This provides type safety at compile time [2].

Before Java 7: You would have had to write the type argument on both sides of the assignment, like this:
java code
ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<Integer>();
With the diamond operator: The compiler can infer the type argument (Integer) from the left side of the assignment. This makes the code cleaner and easier to read:
java code
ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
